# Tommaso Bratto

A young, pro-active italian junior developer and code lover who wishes to learn more about the tech world and loves being involved and collaborating on projects.
I wish to get deeper and deeper into everything concerning coding, web/game development and technology, working with like-minded people to deliver the best products possible.  

## My Projects

## Skills

### Web Software Development

During the 12 weeks-long London code bootcamp Makers Academy we learned about building web software, the structure of a web application, the fundamentals of programming together with the design patterns and best practices involved. Starting to study a subject from scratch in a totally new environment led me to improve my self-learning and teamworking skills.

- Graduated as Junior Web Developer at Makers Academy

### Two Languages

I am a native Italian speaker and I've had a lot of experience during Makers Academy and high school to hone my skills in English speaking and writing. Studying and working for 12 weeks shoulder to shoulder with people from all sorts of countries and backgrounds during the course helped me improve my general and workplace communication skills.

- Obtained Cambridge ESOL PET and FCE certifications in knowledge of the English language 

### Sound Engineering

Self-taught, I understand the very basics of mixing and mastering music with digital software. I love to be able to learn something by doing and understanding the best practices and methods involved in it.

- Produced and engineered the sounds of Vexovoid's self-produced EP Heralds Of The Stars, a local band from Siena, Italy.
