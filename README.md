# Tommaso Bratto

A young, pro-active junior developer who wishes to learn more about his craft and loves being involved and collaborating on projects. I've finished the course at Makers Academy with no previous coding experience, having moved from Italy for that purpose.
I now wish to get deeper and deeper into everything concerning coding, web/game development and nerdy tech stuff, working with like-minded people on real projects and seeing them come to life.

## Favourite Projects

- [Street Pacman](https://github.com/tommasobratto/pacman-clientside), a GPS-driven mobile multiplayer game re-enacting the classic arcade game Pacman in the streets of your city. Made for Makers Academy's last 2 weeks final project. There is also a live version on Heroku: http://street-pacman.herokuapp.com/
- [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/tommasobratto/rock_paper_scissors-challenge), one of Makers Academy's challenges testing your skills in software development/design and problem solving.
- [BlogBook](https://github.com/GruntingUnicorns/blogbook), Makers Academy Makerthon's project, a Makers' WordPress blog aggregator.

## Skills

### Sound Engineering

Self-taught, I understand the very basics of mixing and mastering music with digital software. I love to be able to learn something by doing and understanding the best practices and methods involved in it.

- Produced and engineered the sounds of a local band's self-produced EP - [Vexovoid - Heralds of The Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOzcgVoXehI): [here's a review](http://www.rockandmetalinmyblood.com/recensioni/VEXOVOID---Heralds-of-the-Stars/2014---Indipendent/2116/) saying that "Technically speaking, the production quality is above average, absolutely worthy of a full-length"(written in Italian)
- Produced unpublished demos of other local bands (will update when they will be published)
- Attended to the mastering sessions of full-length album "Distanze" [(here's an example)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IFdkGaWHwI) by local band La Coscienza di Bacco at Virus Studio, Siena
- Experience with learning the use of Cubase and Reaper DAWs, various VST plugins and iZotope Ozone mastering suite

### Two Languages

I'm a native Italian speaker and I've had a lot of experience during high school to hone my skills in English speaking and writing.

- Obtained Cambridge ESOL PET and FCE certifications in knowledge of the English language
